This was very unique as it wasn't like any of the other RE focused CTFs we've played before and the style was really different.</p>\n<p>The entire thing began with a CTF which had all categories you would expect in a normal CTF (RE, Pwn, Web, Forensics). Us being low level guys, managed to get down RE and Pwn, and took a bit of time with Forensics. Sadly Web was too guessy for us 😔 (blind + skill issue). They froze the scoreboard like 30 mins into the CTF but I figure we qualified since they sent us a mail for the next round.</p>\n<p>After the prelims CTF, I think the top 25-30 teams were picked for the next round. The next round was a RE specific CTF. That one was super easy except for one challenge which was broken, I think. They pushed a fix for it and then we solved that too. So far it was looking pretty normal and we weren't sure what the &quot;hackathon&quot; part of this was.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-hackathon-tho\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-hackathon-tho\">#</a> What is a hackathon tho?</h3>\n<p>For context, a Hackathon is a software engineering/development oriented competition wherein teams are given certain topics/themes and guidelines to follow, and they have X amount of time to build a working product or a prototype, which they can then showcase to the judges and based on the judgement received they would get credited a certain number of points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defense-phase\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#defense-phase\">#</a> Defense phase?</h2>\n<p>So after the 2 prelim rounds of CTFs, 20-25 teams were picked for the Hackathon (aka &quot;Defense&quot;) phase. This is where the uniqueness of the entire thing began. We were given a document that outlined what we would need to do and the specifications we were allowed to use. The entire specification is <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xaUJHZ1NCeUdsRDkxdVdVT3o2QlRtQ1JweEN1N21IMUotcmZyTFBEdFdCRS9lZGl0\">here</span>.</p>\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are given a  <code>main.c</code>  file, with 3 sensitive values:  <code>key</code>  (a 16-byte AES Key),  <code>egg_params</code>  (a 5x6 array) and a function  <code>compute_gf()</code></li>\n<li>Each team is given the same core binary with the above 3 things changed</li>\n<li>You &quot;defend&quot; your binary by obfuscating it such that the 3 sensitive values are hard to recover</li>\n<li>You &quot;attack&quot; other binaries by reversing and getting those 3 values, and submit them as flags</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the defense phase, we were given criterion to follow with which we were to obfuscate our binaries. These were pretty basic, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No using any off the shelf obfuscators like UPX, CobaltStrike, etc.</li>\n<li>Code must be written by members of our team, and no one else</li>\n<li>The obfuscated binary must be functionally the same as the original, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay.. enough yap<br />\nThis blog is more to focus on one of the challenges made by some folks at <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9pbmZvc2VjaWl0ci5pbg==\">InfosecIITR</span>.</p>\n<p>They made an LLVM based obfuscator, and while our challenge was something similar, it followed a different style from theirs. We went for a control flow flattening approach - while they went for more of a instruction overlap approach. It was an easy challenge, but I just wanted to showcase some cool things IDAPython is capable of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-challenge\">#</a> The Challenge</h2>\n<p>The binary itself had a behaviour exactly the same as the others in the competition - give it plaintext as a command line argument, and it would encrypt it and give it back to you.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">apollo@apollo:/mnt/f/Work/CTFs/binary-clash-25/attack-phase/3$ ./3_VMwhere</span><br><span class=\"line\">Invalid Usage!!</span><br><span class=\"line\">Usage: ./encrypt &lt;plain_text&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">apollo@apollo:/mnt/f/Work/CTFs/binary-clash-25/attack-phase/3$ ./3_VMwhere hello</span><br><span class=\"line\">Plaintext :: 68 65 6c 6c 6f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</span><br><span class=\"line\">Ciphertext:: a0 6b 44 12 fc bd d2 a0 0c 71 d5 4b ba d6 84 94</span><br><span class=\"line\">Egg 0 : 0x28</span><br><span class=\"line\">Global Flag: 0x77</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Now, looking at it in IDA, I wouldn't say it was the prettiest binary I've ever seen.<br />\nIf you look for the main function in the normal Linux ELF method (look for  <code>start</code> , then find the first argument passed to the function -  <code>libc_start_main</code>  - which is explicitly called by start), you will first off see that IDA marks it as a location and not a subroutine - meaning that something is off already.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image.png\" alt=\"looking at start in IDA Pro\" /></p>\n<p>And at the location:<br />\n<img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-1.png\" alt=\"disassembly of main\" /></p>\n<p>That definitely does not look right.</p>\n<p>The  <code>jmp</code>  at  <code>0x40B234</code>  definitely looks suspicious, why is it jumping to the address of its own basic block + 5?</p>\n<p>You can press  <code>u</code>  to undefine code at a given position in IDA, and  <code>c</code>  to redefine it as code. Let us undefine code starting from  <code>0x40B228</code> , and defone code starting at  <code>0x40B228 + 5</code>  -&gt;  <code>0x40B22D</code> , and see where that takes us.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-2.png\" alt=\"hidden jump\" /></p>\n<p>Looks like the code there is being interpreted as data, we can fix that easily (hit  <code>u</code>  at that address and then hit  <code>c</code> ). Doing so, gives us this</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-3.png\" alt=\"hidden jump but fr this time\" /></p>\n<p>Well well well, what do we have here? A hidden  <code>jmp</code>  instruction.</p>\n<p>Analysing the code at that location gives us similar looking stuff</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-4.png\" alt=\"2nd obfuscation place\" /></p>\n<p>Applying the same stuff again, gives us the same results, except an instruction before the same old block again</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-7.png\" alt=\"jmp which leads to actual stuff\" /></p>\n<p>Again, with this  <code>jmp</code>  leading to a similar looking block, i.e:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>mov</code>  a random 8-byte value into  <code>rax</code></li>\n<li><code>xor eax, eax</code></li>\n<li><code>jmp</code>  into a location which is 5 bytes ahead of the basic block it belongs to, which will jump to a new location which may/may not have some code there, before it enters the same block again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point in the competition the pattern was clear to me, and I started figuring out a way to extract just the instructions we need (between the real  <code>jmp</code>  and before the next obfuscated block). So I settled on writing down an IDAPython script for this, since I work mainly with IDA Pro anyways.</p>\n<p>My idea was this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for instructions matching the format mentioned above</li>\n<li>If the instruction is found, then find the 5th byte offset from the start of the block, and extract the address of the real  <code>jmp</code>  from on there</li>\n<li>At the new  <code>jmp</code>  address, keep reading instructions until you meet the next instruction matching the block</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rinse. Repeat.</p>\n<p>I wanted to take this as a chance to check out how good IDA's Python API was, and basically take it on a test drive.</p>\n<p>Now I had to write an IDA Script to this (🗿), ahem, so we shall do that next</p>\n<p>The IDA Python documentation isn't exactly the best (if someone actually does find something, please hit me up), so I kind of had to rely mostly on <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9ncmVwLmFwcA==\">grep.app</span> to see examples of stuff similar to what I want to do.</p>\n<p>Some time of dilly dallying, and I made a rough script to fix up the main function.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span

binary - whichever functions were being called that is. So I went with a DFS approach.<br />\nFrom main, make a list of all the functions being called from inside it. Subsequently, add those to the &quot;deobfuscation&quot; queue. Likewise, keep going until there are no functions left.</p>\n<p>Also one annoying thing is inside IDA's API, all the instructions and registers are stored using codes instead of their actual names. I found that the method I've used in my script works for most cases.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

I encountered some build issues, realized that a few steps in the instructions were incorrect, and submitted a PR to correct them. It wasn’t until later that I fully grasped the impact of that contribution. Knowing that my small fix could help others avoid the same frustration gave me a sense of fulfillment.</p>\n<p>I discovered RTEMS while exploring organizations participating in GSoC 2024. As I browsed through the list of projects, one in particular caught my eye — tagged with  <code>GDB</code>  and  <code>Python</code> . Given my background in Reverse Engineering, I was immediately drawn to it and knew I wanted to make it my project. When I received my GSoC acceptance email on May 2nd, during my 2nd year in Undergrad College, I knew this summer was going to be something special. I had heard a lot about the mentor-mentee model that GSoC champions and was eager to experience it firsthand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-project\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#about-the-project\">#</a> About the Project</h2>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/GSoC-Final-Report/RTEMS-logo.png\" alt=\"rtems logo\" /></p>\n<p>RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for embedded systems requiring high reliability and deterministic behavior.</p>\n<p>RTEMS provides the capability to build custom toolchains tailored to various target architectures, leveraging standard tools like GCC, Binutils, GDB and many more. These tools are essential for compiling, linking and debugging embedded applications on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>The project involved modifying the <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VyY2V3YXJlLm9yZy9nZGIv\">GNU Debugger (GDB)</span> to enhance its debugging capabilities within RTEMS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problem-statement\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-statement\">#</a> Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>GDB includes built-in support for automatically loading Python, but this feature is limited to dynamic executables. In such cases, when a specific library is loaded by the object file in GDB, the linker triggers GDB to load the corresponding pretty-printing scripts for that library.</p>\n<p>However, RTEMS is fully statically linked, and this automatic loading does not apply to statically linked executables. Without a linker to notify GDB when a library is loaded, Python is not automatically loaded. As a result, many features that rely on Python are unavailable, leading to a significant loss in functionality during debugging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-goals\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-goals\">#</a> Project Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate a Python initializer into GDB for RTEMS to facilitate enhanced debugging.</li>\n<li>Enable GDB to automatically load pretty-printing scripts for RTEMS structures and libstdcxx classes.</li>\n<li>Seamlessly integrate these changes into the RTEMS toolchain, reducing the need for involvement from the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#approach\">#</a> Approach</h2>\n<p>A brief summary of my approach is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Exploration:</strong> I began by reviewing existing solutions employed by companies like Rust and AdaCore, which typically involve adding a wrapper over the host GDB to resolve paths for pretty-printers. To gain deeper insights, I engaged in discussions with developers from both companies as well as with GDB developers to understand the rationale behind this approach. However, I found this method unsuitable for RTEMS due to its use of a distinct toolchain for each build, separate from the host toolchain. Additionally, the wrapper approach proved to be generally inefficient for our needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Implemented Solution:</strong> I introduced a .debug_gdb_scripts section to every ELF binary. This was done by adding the section in the  <code>cpukit/sapi/src/exinit.c</code>  file, since it is linked to every application built on RTEMS. As a result, every RTEMS-built application now includes this section.</li>\n<li><strong>Python script execution:</strong> This new executable section contains a snippet of Python code that corrects paths and triggers GDB to run a script called  <code>pprinter.py</code> . This script is responsible for registering both libstdcxx and RTEMS pretty-printers.</li>\n<li><strong>Toolchain Integration:</strong> The  <code>stdcxx.py</code>  script, which registers the  <code>libstdcxx</code>  pretty-printers, needs to know the version of GCC being used since the pretty-printer scripts provided by GCC vary with versions. Therefore, the script is built alongside the toolchain to ensure compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>RTEMS Pretty-Printer Registration:</strong> Finally, the  <code>pprinter.py</code>  script invokes a build function from rtems_pprinter.py, which registers all the RTEMS-specific pretty-printers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a flow chart highlighting the work flow underwent for the entire project:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/GSoC-Final-Report/project-flowchart.png\" alt=\"project flow chart\" /></p>\n<p>(Note: The boxes in Blue signify changes that apply to every

id=\"integrating-python-and-gdb-with-static-linking-in-rtems\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#integrating-python-and-gdb-with-static-linking-in-rtems\">#</a> Integrating Python and GDB with Static Linking in RTEMS</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>RTEMS uses static linking, which complicates GDB's ability to automatically load Python scripts, a feature that works for dynamically linked executables. This required developing a <a href=\"#approach\">custom solution</a> to ensure Python scripts could be executed within the RTEMS environment.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"developing-a-custom-solution-for-script-loading\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#developing-a-custom-solution-for-script-loading\">#</a> Developing a Custom Solution for Script Loading</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>The conventional methods for loading Python scripts in GDB did not apply to RTEMS. I had to devise a new method to introduce a  <code>.debug_gdb_scripts</code>  section in RTEMS executables.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 id=\"things-learned\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#things-learned\">#</a> Things Learned:</h3>\n<h4 id=\"adaptability-and-problem-solving\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#adaptability-and-problem-solving\">#</a> Adaptability and Problem-Solving</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>I learned to adapt to unexpected challenges, such as implementing a novel solution for integrating Python into GDB for RTEMS. This required creativity and persistence, especially when initial approaches did not work.</li>\n<li>Developed a stronger ability to think outside the box and approach problems from different angles.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"effective-communication\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#effective-communication\">#</a> Effective Communication</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Regular communication with mentors and team members was crucial. Coordinating through platforms like Discord and GitLab helped me understand the importance of clear, consistent updates and feedback.</li>\n<li>Enhanced skills in articulating ideas and progress effectively, which is vital for collaborative work.</li>\n</ul>\n<h4 id=\"time-management\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#time-management\">#</a> Time Management</h4>\n<ul>\n<li>Balancing the demands of GSoC with other commitments required careful planning and prioritization.

We can see that the challenge binary was compiled with the  <code>-fno-stack-protector</code>  option, what does that do?</p>\n<p>Well, before we discuss that I think a small refresher on the stack would be nice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-stack-refresher\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#a-stack-refresher\">#</a> A Stack Refresher</h3>\n<p>(I will be using  <code>x86_64</code>  as an example to explain)</p>\n<p>The stack is used to store local variables (on a per-function basis) during program runtime.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>It is also important to clarify the difference between 2 terms: &quot;stack space&quot; and &quot;stack frame&quot;.</p>\n<p>Stack space is the space allocated by your OS for your current program, there is one stack space assigned per program, which is some amount of space in the RAM.</p>\n<p>Stack frame is the &quot;stack&quot; structure itself which is used up per-function in your program - each function has its own stack frame.<br />\nStack frames are constructed and destructed for every function that executes, and there can only be ONE stack frame in the current context at any given time. That means, only one stack pointer ( <code>rsp</code>  in x86-64), which points to the top of the stack - whichever is in the current context, and one base pointer ( <code>rbp</code>  in x86-64), which points to the base of the stack in the current context.</p>\n<p>So, if each function needs to have its own frame, we need a way to save each function's base and top pointers, right?</p>\n<p>First, let us look at how a normal stack looks for a regular function (say  <code>main()</code> )</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-2.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>(In actuality, the stack grows <em>downwards</em> in memory, i.e, the stack pointer is the one moving down when the base pointer stays constant above it, but I am just drawing it this way for easier visualisation)</p>\n<p>Okay, now we need to see how each function can maintain it's own stack frame while the overall program still uses only 2 pointers - one for the current stack top and another for the current stack base.</p>\n<p>Let us see how  <code>x86-64</code>  handles this.</p>\n<p>(I am assuming at least basic assembly knowledge at the time of writing this)</p>\n<p>Okay, let us say we are in main, with source code as follows:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight c\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"type\">int</span> <span class=\"title function_\">main</span><span class=\"params\">(<span class=\"type\">int</span> argc, <span class=\"type\">char</span> *argv[])</span> </span><br><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"type\">int</span> x = <span class=\"number\">5</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"type\">int</span> y = <span class=\"number\">7</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">/* Assume find_sum() is defined somewhere in the program */</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    find_sum(x, y);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"number\">0</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>At the line of the call to  <code>find_sum()</code> , the stack would have some values (these depend on the compiler you are using, but not of our concern anyways - what we are bothered with is the top and base pointers). Let us see the stack right <em>before</em> the call to  <code>find_sum()</code> :</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-3.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: The  <code>rsp</code>  and  <code>rbp</code>  only <em>point</em> to the top and bottom, they do not contain the values at the bottom/top of the stack - those can be gotten by dereferencing these pointers)</p>\n<p>So, the next line is our function call, let us see what happens.</p>\n<p>First off, every function call is translated into assembly as a  <code>call</code>  instruction, which transfers control flow to a different part of the code.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"># something like this</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rdi, 5</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rsi, 7</span><br><span class=\"line\">call find_sum</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"># remaining instructions in the program </span><br><span class=\"line\">mov eax, 0</span><br><span class=\"line\">leave </span><br><span class=\"line\">ret</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>We can see that there are also instructions after the call instruction, so once the different part of the code finishes executing, control flow would need to return to the next instruction ( <code>mov eax, 0</code> , in our case).</p>\n<p>Luckily for us, we have a register which tracks the address of the next instruction:  <code>rip</code> . Let us use that.</p>\n<p>To store  <code>rip</code>  temporarily, we can push it onto the stack.</p>\n<p>The  <code>call</code>  instruction in  <code>x86-64</code>  is actuall abstracted into 2 separate instructions:  <code>push rip</code>  and  <code>jmp rip</code> , so the control flow of our program is transferred there.</p>\n<p>Currently, our stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-4.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Now, what Intel does here is interesting.</p>\n<p>First, the old <em>value</em> of  <code>rbp</code>  is pushed onto the stack</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-5.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Now that the old  <code>rbp</code>  value is safe, the current top, is set as the new base (i.e,  <code>rsp</code>  and  <code>rbp</code>  now contain the same values, effectively pointing to the same address).</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-7.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /><br />\nAnd now, the stack for the new function is set up! The function is free to use its frame however it pleases (as long as it does not use up all the stack space allocated by the OS!).</p>\n<p>If we had to put what I just showed in pictures and translate it to assembly, it would look a little something like this:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"># save the old value of rbp on the stack</span><br><span class=\"line\">push rbp </span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"># rbp = rsp, effectively setting the new &quot;base&quot; to the previous &quot;top&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rbp, rsp</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Now, logically, returning from a function would follow the opposite steps as setting up a stack frame for a function.</p>\n<p>First, the stack top pointer is brought down to the current base (opposite of what happened for setting up)</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-8.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next, the top value on the stack (which was the old base pointer) is popped into  <code>rbp</code> . This effectively moves the base pointer back to where it previously was.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-9.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next, the top value on the stack (which was the old value of  <code>rip</code> ), is popped into  <code>rip</code>  (this is abstracted as the instruction:  <code>ret</code> ).</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-10.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>And that's how it's done!</p>\n<p>This is how you can use just 2 pointers to effectively have however many stack frames you want (1 per function).</p>\n<p>Now, back to the challenge 😃</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis-continued\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#analysis-continued\">#</a> Analysis: continued</h2>\n<p>The  <code>-fno-stack-protector</code>  turns off the option to add a stack protection mechanism known as the &quot;stack cookie&quot; or the &quot;stack canary&quot;. Why does the stack need protection, though?</p>\n<p>Well, we have seen that, during a function call, the stack stores 2 critical values: the old base pointer ( <code>rbp</code> ) and the return address from where code flow needs to continue after the function call ( <code>rip</code> ). What if I can overwrite these values?</p>\n<p>What if there are some library functions (for example:  <code>gets</code> ), which use the stack as a buffer to store the value we give it, but do not perform any bound/size checks, and will accept any length of input and place it as it is on the stack?  <code>gets</code>  is one such example of a library function which does not care about the size of the input you give it, it will eat up as many characters as you give it.</p>\n<p>This effectively means I can overwrite the  <code>rip</code>  with whatever value I want, meaning I control the flow of execution of the program going forward.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-11.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>A stack canary is a kind of boundary wall that is used to prevent such attacks. It is a random value that is generated each time the program is run, and placed between the old  <code>rbp</code>  and any value(s) the function uses the stack for storing. So the new stack looks a little something like this:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-12.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>The value of this canary is checked to see if it it was overwritten with something else. If it is not what it's supposed to be, the program simply exits. It is difficult (but not impossible in some cases), to beat this.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-13.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next up,  <code>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</code>  - this just tells the compiler to keep quiet and not warn about any deprecated function(s) we might be using in our program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-program-analysis\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#step-2-program-analysis\">#</a> Step 2: Program Analysis</h2>\n<p>Before we try running the program, we need to make sure the binary is patched to refer to the linker and libc that we have been given in the handout. Luckily, there is a very handy tool for doing just this: <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2lvMTIvcHduaW5pdA==\">pwninit</span>.</p>\n<p>Just install and run  <code>pwninit</code>  from the challenge directory and it will do the patching for you, and will generated a separate patched file, with the needed changes.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-14.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>This is what we get from running the binary a couple of times, let us open it up in IDA.</p>\n<p>Immediately, we can see a bunch of  <code>station_&lt;number&gt;</code>  functions, probably the function that gets called based on the station number we input, and it gets there using a  <code>jmp</code>  table. You can tell this because of the  <code>__asm &#123; jmp     rax &#125;</code>  that IDA has placed in the pseudocode. You can recover any jump table in IDA if you notice this by following this <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXgtcmF5cy5jb20vYmxvZy9pZ29ycy10aXAtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWstNTMtbWFudWFsLXN3aXRjaC1pZGlvbXMv\">blog</span>.</p>\n<p>In the  <code>select_station</code>  function itself, we can see there is a call to  <code>printf</code>  with the input that we give to the program. This is a format string vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability\">#</a> What is a format string vulnerability?</h3>\n<p>In assembly, there is something known as a &quot;calling convention&quot;. This refers to the places where any function looks at first when it is called, to know what arguments were passed to it.</p>\n<p>In  <code>x86-64</code>  the calling convention is as follows:  <code>rdi</code> ,  <code>rsi</code> ,  <code>rdx</code> ,  <code>rcx</code> ,  <code>r8</code> ,  <code>r9</code> . If a function has more arguments than this, the stack is used for the remaining ones.</p>\n<p>This just means that, printf (and all other functions) will look at these registers in these order, followed by the stack to know what it has to print out to the console.</p>\n<p>Now in our program, the printf call is vulnerable because it does not inherently control how many values it prints out. Compare the following 2 printf calls:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">printf(&quot;%s&quot;, arg);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">printf(arg);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>The first one is alright, because there is only 1 format specifier passed when  <code>printf()</code>  is called, and we cannot change that, but the second one is vulnerable - in the sense, we can print out however many values we want, in whatever format we want.</p>\n<p>Before we get to exploiting this format string vulnerability, we also need to identify vulnerable functions, so how do we pick that?</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-3-reversing\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#step-3-reversing\">#</a> Step 3: Reversing</h2>\n<p>A little analysis shows us that there exist 3 different kind of functions, functions that:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Take ticket code through  <code>gets()</code></li>\n<li>Take ticket code through  <code>fgets()</code> , then use  <code>strcpy()</code>  to copy it elsewhere</li>\n<li>Take ticket code through  <code>scanf()</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>All 3 have some or the other kind of BOF (buffer overflow) vulnerability, but there is one thing to keep in mind about each function here:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>gets()</code>  stops taking input at the first newline ( <code>0xa</code> )</li>\n<li><code>scanf()</code>  stops taking input at the first whitespace character in general</li>\n<li><code>strcpy()</code>  stops at the first null byte</li>\n</ol>\n<p>(I kind of guessed that  <code>gets()</code>  would be the vulnerable function, it as well as could have been any other, in which case my script can be easily modified, but oh well)</p>\n<p>Let us pick a random  <code>gets()</code>  function and examine it.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-15.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Seems pretty straightforward, except one thing: a predefined stack canary is being loaded, not by the compiler. Meaning, we have all the stack canary values already, we would not need to spend timing finding/leaking it 😃</p>\n<p>Of course, the author would not want things to be this easy, so let us examine the canary as well</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">__stack_chk_guard_10 = 0x456B0A4E4C74784F</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Ahh, there is a newline in there.</p>\n<p>This is an issue because, if we do end up exploiting the buffer overflow vulnerability in  <code>gets()</code> , we would need to keep the canary intact so as to not have the program detect an overwrite and exit.<br />\nTo do this, we would need to pass the canary as part of the input, and doing that would prematurely end the  <code>gets()</code>  function since there is also a newline in the canary.</p>\n<p>Examining a couple more stations shows us that this is the case for every  <code>gets()</code>  function so far, as well as  <code>scanf()</code>  and  <code>strcpy()</code>  functions</p>\n<p>So, we need to find a single function where this is not the case. For this, we can utilise IDA scripting with the IDAPython API.</p>\n<p>Here is the general idea:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Generate a list of all functions calling  <code>gets()</code></li>\n<li>Generate a list of all stack canaries without a newline</li>\n<li>Compare to see if there are common functions between the two lists</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So let us write a script to do just that.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br><span class=\"line\">33</span><br><span class=\"line\">34</span><br><span class=\"line\">35</span><br><span class=\"line\">36</span><br><span class=\"line\">37</span><br><span class=\"line\">38</span><br><span class=\"line\">39</span><br><span class=\"line\">40</span><br><span class=\"line\">41</span><br><span class=\"line\">42</span><br><span class=\"line\">43</span><br><span class=\"line\">44</span><br><span class=\"line\">45</span><br><span class=\"line\">46</span><br><span class=\"line\">47</span><br><span class=\"line\">48</span><br><span class=\"line\">49</span><br><span class=\"line\">50</span><br><span class=\"line\">51</span><br><span class=\"line\">52</span><br><span class=\"line\">53</span><br><span class=\"line\">54</span><br><span class=\"line\">55</span><br><span class=\"line\">56</span><br><span class=\"line\">57</span><br><span class=\"line\">58</span><br><span class=\"line\">59</span><br><span class=\"line\">60</span><br><span class=\"line\">61</span><br><span class=\"line\">62</span><br><span class=\"line\">63</span><br><span class=\"line\">64</span><br><span class=\"line\">65</span><br><span class=\"line\">66</span><br><span class=\"line\">67</span><br><span class=\"line\">68</span><br><span class=\"line\">69</span><br><span class=\"line\">70</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">import</span> idautils</span><br><span class=\"line\"> </span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">find_xrefs_to</span>(<span class=\"params\">address</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">    given an address, find all addresses calling that address</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">    &#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    xrefs = []</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> ref <span class=\"keyword\">in</span> idautils.CodeRefsTo(address, <span class=\"number\">0</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">        xrefs.append(ref)</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> xrefs</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">get_stack_canaries</span>():</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"string\">&#x27;&#x27;&#x27;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">    given the base address, generate a dictionary of in the format </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">    &#123;station_number: canary_value&#125;

From the Dockerfile we saw earlier, the idea is to get a shell and do  <code>cat flag.txt</code> , so let's see how we can do it.</p>\n<p>Back to the format string vulnerability.</p>\n<p>We know the  <code>printf()</code>  in  <code>select_station</code>  is vulnerable, and we know why. Let us view the register state before the  <code>printf()</code>  call in  <code>select_station</code></p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-16.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Running  <code>info proc mappings</code>  on GDB tells us what is mapped to where in virtual memory, so we can make use of that here</p>\n<p>We can see that the address that  <code>rsi</code>  contains is actually a LIBC address!</p>\n<p>We can assume ASLR is on for this program.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing to note about ASLR is that while it does modify the actual addresses of variables and functions in your program, it usually does not touch the distance between these variables (this distance is also known as an &quot;offset&quot;).</p>\n<p>For example, if we run a program for the first time, and a variable  <code>x</code>  is at address  <code>0x1000</code> , and a variable  <code>y</code>  is at  <code>0x1050</code> , and we run this program for a second time, we would see that the address of the variable  <code>x</code>  has now changed to  <code>0x1450</code> , but  <code>y</code>  remains a constant offset from it at  <code>0x14a0</code> .</p>\n<p>This is because it would take way too long for ASLR to randomise the locations of <em>every</em> single variable in a given program. What is does instead is randomise the <em>base</em> address of various memory mappings, one of which is LIBC.</p>\n<p>We can utilise this fact to find the base address of  <code>libc</code>  every time the program is run. This is known as a  <code>ret2libc</code>  attack</p>\n<p>There are 4 main steps to  <code>ret2libc</code>  attacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find an address that points to something in the libc by using something like a format string vulnerability</li>\n<li>Use the address above to calculate the base address of libc</li>\n<li>Calculate addresses of any libc functions we like using the base address</li>\n<li>Use a different exploit (BOF in our case) to overwrite the return address with the libc function we would like to jump to</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us leak an address as an example, by running the program with the input &quot;14927-%p-&quot;</p>\n<p>The output I get is:  <code>0x7ffff7fc2723</code></p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-17.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>All I have to do, is subtract the base address of the  <code>libc</code>  I have (highlighted in the screenshot), from it, to get the constant offset difference, which comes out to be:  <code>0x1ed723</code> . I can use this information to get the base address of the libc every time the program is run now, through the format string vulnerability in  <code>main()</code> .</p>\n<p>Return Oriented Programming comes in handy when buffer overflows allow us to overwrite a program's call stack with what we want. Instead of us having to craft our own shellcode, all we have to do is take already existing pieces of code (known as &quot;gadgets&quot;) and put them together to craft our exploit - we will see how we can do that.</p>\n<p>These gadgets are usually short bursts of instructions tailored to do specific things, each ending with a  <code>ret</code>  instruction. We can utilise this to control execution flow as per our will.</p>\n<p>The beauty of ROP comes from it's unique ability to harness code from any part of the binary (given it is executable).</p>\n<p>First, we need to go gadget hunting to find what we need. Since we can write what we want to the stack, and we know  <code>rdi</code>  is the first place looked at by functions for their arguments, we would ideally want something that would allow us to pop the top value from the stack and into  <code>rdi</code> , then perform a  <code>ret</code> . Let us look for such an instruction in the libc with a tool known as <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL0pvbmF0aGFuU2Fsd2FuL1JPUGdhZGdldA==\">ROPgadget</span>.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ ROPgadget --binary ./libc.so.6 | grep &quot;pop rdi ; ret&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x0000000000023b6a : pop rdi ; ret</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x00000000000f57ad : pop rdi ; retf</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x0000000000144ba9 : pop rdi ; retf 0xa</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>We can take the first one and ignore the rest. The output shows that at the offset  <code>0x24b6a</code>  from the libc base, is the gadget we are looking for.</p>\n<p>Next, we also need to find a  <code>ret</code>  instruction.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ ROPgadget

<code>ret</code>  is at 0x22679.</p>\n<p>Now, we are ready to craft our payload that does the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Send 4 &quot;A&quot;s and the canary to get to the return address on the stack</li>\n<li>Overwrite the return address on the stack with the  <code>pop rdi</code>  gadget</li>\n<li>Set the value of  <code>rdi</code>  to &quot;/bin/sh&quot;</li>\n<li>Overwrite the return address again with with the address of system</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us see how this can be accomplished with a full fledged pwntools script</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td

I already have quite a bit of experience working with GDB, and use it almost daily while Reverse Engineering or during CTFs.<br />\nFor those of you that are not familiar, CTF stands for &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;. It is a competition wherein the hosting team creates and puts out challenges/services that are intentionally vulnerable - usually in a way that is specific to a single field of Cyber Security - and the point of the challenge is to figure out what the vulnerability is and use it to get a text string from it called a &quot;flag&quot;. Capture more flags, gain more points. I play CTFs with <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9iaTBzLmlu\">team bi0s</span>.</p>\n<p>GDB has an awesome Python API that it utilizes to do things it cannot do straight out the box, and one such thing is pretty-printing.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have a weird class/structure in your program, and you want to view it in memory, so you pop it open in GDB. Then you print your variable in GDB and it spits out something so awful that you wish you never started debugging in the first place. This is because GDB obviously cannot know about any and every single structure out there, and sometimes it needs a little help - this is where the awesome Python API I mentioned comes in.</p>\n<p>Python essentially hooks onto GDB and interprets something GDB might be unable to, then do some Python magic and voila, you have the same structure neatly formatted! Some nice examples and a deeper explanation of what pretty-printing can be found in the <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VyY2V3YXJlLm9yZy9nZGIvY3VycmVudC9vbmxpbmVkb2NzL2dkYi5odG1sL1ByZXR0eS1QcmludGluZy5odG1sI1ByZXR0eS1QcmludGluZw==\">documentation</span></p>\n<p>GCC ships pretty-printing scripts for  <code>libstdcxx</code> , which is essentially all of the C++ STL Structures, and my job is to get the GDB installed on <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucnRlbXMub3Jn\">RTEMS</span> to automatically load these pretty-printing scripts at load-time, to enhance the debugging experience on RTEMS 😃. Next, add pretty-printing support for kernel structures present on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>Starting off, I already had a couple of things to get ticked off my checklist. I mainly wanted to set up a proper debugging environment, and also study various commonly used kernel structures - before diving deeper into my project. Since my project itself was to extend the functionality of the debugger, what good is it if I don't have a debugging environment setup in place?</p>\n<p>Let's jump right into my debugger setup then.</p>\n<p>I am working on a Windows 11 (x64), WSL2 (Arch) system. On top of this, I have the RTEMS tooling installed from the instructions in their <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnJ0ZW1zLm9yZy9icmFuY2hlcy9tYXN0ZXIvdXNlci9zdGFydC9zb3VyY2VzLmh0bWw=\">documentation</span>. On top of that, they provide a variety of options to build various BSPs (think of BSPs as housing for the OS to be embedded upon). I needed a build setup such that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could compile RTEMS C++ programs at will</li>\n<li>GDB could debug those programs remotely through a remote emulator (either built in, or using <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucWVtdS5vcmc=\">Qemu</span>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, to build a BSP. I had to make 2 important choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which architecture will I use?</li>\n<li>Which BSP will I use for said architecture? (Note: A single architecture can support multiple BSPs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I initially thought  <code>x86_64</code>  arch, along with any suitable BSP for that arch would have me good to go, but I was sadly mistaken. Not only did I struggle to find BSPs for  <code>x86_64</code> , but I also found that there were no test configurations (yet) for any of the  <code>x86_64</code>  BSPs 😦, so I decided not to proceed with that</p>\n<p>Next up, I chose the  <code>sparc</code>  arch, along with the  <code>erc32</code>  BSP, since that was one which seemed to have very good support for emulation and GDB support, and was also the one used in most of the examples mentioned in the docs. So I went ahead and built that.</p>\n<p><code>sparc</code>  has an emulator built in in RTEMS,  <code>sparc-rtems6-sis</code>  ( <code>sis</code> : Sparc Instruction Set Simulator), which can emulate the instructions of the RTEMS executable, and GDB can attach to the process through a TCP port.</p>\n<p>However, although compiling RTEMS C++ programs and running them worked perfectly on my  <code>sparc/erc32</code>  build, I couldn't debug (i.e, step through) code conveniently. I kept hitting some kind of data access violation exception, due to which RTEMS would have a fatal crash and exit. Sad.</p>\n<p>So I finalised on the  <code>arm/xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu</code>  BSP upon the suggestion of my mentor, which worked perfectly. So, I will be using that for the rest of this blog.</p>\n<p>First, a sample C++ program.<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight cpp\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// main.cc </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;numeric&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;vector&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"type\">int</span> <span class=\"title\">main</span><span class=\"params\">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">auto</span> v = std::<span class=\"built_in\">vector</span>&lt;<span class=\"type\">int</span>&gt;(<span class=\"number\">5</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    std::<span class=\"built_in\">iota</span>(std::<span class=\"built_in\">begin</span>(v), std::<span class=\"built_in\">end</span>(v), <span class=\"number\">0</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    </span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"keyword\">auto</span> i : v) </span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"number\">0</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>First off, RTEMS uses  <code>waf</code>  (an alternative to  <code>make</code> ), to build BSPs and applications on the platform. It's pretty versatile and easy to understand. You need 2 main things to build any app like this on RTEMS (apart from the source, of course) -  <code>waf</code>  (the script doing all the work) &amp;  <code>wscript</code>  (the waf script containing instructions to be executed). Apart from these 2 files, you would also need some dependency files, and an initialisation script.</p>\n<p><span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnJ0ZW1zLm9yZy9icmFuY2hlcy9tYXN0ZXIvdXNlci9zdGFydC9hcHAuaHRtbA==\">This</span> page in the documentation gives a pretty good overview on how one can build an app on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>Here is my  <code>wscript</code>  for all C++ applications like the one above:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># wscript </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> print_function</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">rtems_version = <span class=\"string\">&quot;6&quot;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">try</span>:</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> rtems_waf.rtems <span class=\"keyword\">as</span> rtems</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">except</span>:</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"built_in\">print</span>(<span class=\"string\">&#x27;error: no rtems_waf git submodule&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> sys</span><br><span class=\"line\">    sys.exit(<span class=\"number\">1</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">init</span>(<span class=\"params\">ctx</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.init(ctx, version = rtems_version, long_commands = <span class=\"literal\">True</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">bsp_configure</span>(<span class=\"params\">conf, arch_bsp</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\"># Add BSP specific configuration checks</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">pass</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">options</span>(<span class=\"params\">opt</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.options(opt)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">configure</span>(<span class=\"params\">conf</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.configure(conf, bsp_configure = bsp_configure)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">build</span>(<span class=\"params\">bld</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.build(bld)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    bld(features = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;cxx cxxprogram&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        target = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;cxx_stdvec.exe&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        cxxflags = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;-std=c++11 -g -O2 -lstdc++&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        source = [<span class=\"string\">&#x27;main.cc&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"string\">&#x27;rtems_config.c&#x27;</span>])</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>The main function we need to focus on is  <code>build</code> .

If you happen to be an expert in the .NET compilation and runtime process, and also know how to read assembly, then I have some great news for you: you can skip past a bunch of stuff I'm about to talk about and jump right into Reversing it (although I'd appreciate you giving it a read for the 3 cans of chocolate milk that went into making this post).</p>\n<p>Okay, so let's jump right into it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-is-net\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-net\">#</a> What is .NET?</h2>\n<p>Essentially, .NET is simply a framework developed by Microsoft. Early on, they realised that having different kinds of languages across different kind of platforms was going to get real messy real soon, so they decided to have a common ground for all of them to exist and thrive on: .NET.<br />\nIt helps to think of it as an abstraction layer. Developers don't have to bother about what platform they're writing their programs for (hardware/software, OS, graphics, optimisation, etc.), they can focus on writing good software, and if that software is capable of running on the .NET framework on one device, it is more than likely it will run on all other devices as well (where .NET is installed, of course). Everything from the different languages to the runtime engine - all come under .NET.</p>\n<p>Now that we've gotten that out of the way</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-are-the-different-ways-of-converting-source-to-machine-code\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-are-the-different-ways-of-converting-source-to-machine-code\">#</a> What are the different ways of converting source to machine code?</h2>\n<p>Although I am aware there are tons of ways to &quot;compile&quot; code, this blog post is not about that, so I'm going to oversimplify it. We can broadly categorise this conversion into 3 different categories:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Compiling (C, C++)</li>\n<li>Interpreting (Python)</li>\n<li>JIT Compiling (Java, C#)</li>\n</ol>\n<p><strong>Compiling</strong> - Turn all of your source code into machine code, and store it that way. Advantage? Code is super-fast, since everything is already in a form understood by your machine, and all necessary optimisations have been performed. Disadvantage? Even a small change in your code will warrant a full re-compile of the code to form a new binary, with new optimisations, which is a time consuming and pretty complex process for larger projects consisting of lots of binaries.</p>\n<p><strong>Interpreting</strong> - Think of this as translator between you and a person that speaks a foreign language, except the person speaking the foreign language is your CPU. There is a layer in the middle that &quot;interprets&quot; each line of your code as it executes in real time, and all checks (except syntax) are performed, and each line is independent of the other. Meaning, if I have a piece of code that looks like this:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">for</span> i <span class=\"keyword\">in</span> <span class=\"built_in\">range</span>(<span class=\"number\">1000000000</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"built_in\">print</span>(<span class=\"string\">&quot;meow&quot;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>The line containing the print statement would get interpreted by the translator 1000000000 different times, without it ever knowing it had just done that a couple nanoseconds back. This is an insane waste of time, because it repeating the same process over and over again, with applying 0 optimisations.</p>\n<p>That doesn't sound very nice, no? Why would you <em>not</em> optimise despite knowing that code is being repeated so much?<br />\nThat brings us to the next mode of conversion: JIT Compiling.</p>\n<p><strong>JIT Compiling</strong> - JIT (Just In Time) is a method of compilation, most popularly used by Java (Java Virtual Machine), so I will be taking Java as a reference when explaining this.<br />\nWhen the JVM is running, all methods are compiled in a tiered and on a need-basis. They all start out similar to an interpreter, where the JVM directly reads the bytecode of a single line and executes it. The catch, however, is when a specific unit (called the  <code>CompilerBroker</code>  in the JVM) decides that a method is being invoked very often, it compiles that specific method (known as a &quot;Hot method&quot;) into the next tier of compilation (the  <code>C1</code>  compiler), and then it is profiled (in order to apply further optimisations), and so on. Essentially, it can be thought of a rainbow land between compiling and interpreting, where code is only compiled on a per-need basis.</p>\n<p>So, in order of efficiency - we can arrange the above 3 methods in the following order:<br />\n <code>Compiling &gt;&gt; JIT Compilation &gt;&gt;&gt; Interpreting</code></p>\n<h2 id=\"okay-what-now\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#okay-what-now\">#</a> Okay, what now?</h2>\n<p>Why did I discuss all this, though? Well, .NET happens to be mainly JIT Compiled, and just like how Java has the JVM (Java Virtual Machine), .NET has the CLR (Common Language Runtime) which handles JITting code.</p>\n<p>Through the years, .NET assembly has only contained the IL (Intermediate Language) code, which needs to be compiled and interpreted into its form of native code by the JIT Compiler after the application begins to run. As the .NET framework started expanding its support to more forms of hardware/software platforms, and was capable of building various kinds of applications, a lot of stress was put on Microsoft to improve the performance of the engine as it was the bottleneck for performance of the application as a whole. Some improvements were made, and one such improvement was AOT (Ahead of Time) compiling.</p>\n<h2 id=\"down-to-business\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#down-to-business\">#</a> Down to business</h2>\n<p>There is a specific form of AOT Compiling, supported from .NET Core 3.0+, called R2R (Ready to Run). In this method, code is compiled and kept ahead of time. This kind of takes a lot of the weight off the runtime engine, since a lot of the code need not be compiled at runtime, and the pre-compiled code can be used instead. A lot of the original factors of the binary, like the metadata, and a bunch of old and new headers are required for this method as well (Why is this important? we'll find out).</p>\n<p>This introduces the issue.</p>\n<p>The code compiled ahead of time is obviously more efficient/optimal than the code the JIT engine would generate at runtime, and both of them would be more or less the same regardless. In R2R compiling, IL code is still produced, but it is not JIT compiled because the engine is smart enough to recognise and say, &quot;Hey! This (the compiled version of the code I want to execute) is already present, I can just use that!&quot;. The IL is only present there for our sake, but is never actually used. And this IL is the code that is used by popular decompilers like DnSpyEx/ILSpy to show us what any given .NET binary might be doing.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image.png\" alt=\"do you see the problem here?\" /></p>\n<p>Are you seeing the issue yet?<br />\n(THE IL CODE WE SEE IS NEVER EVEN BEING USED!!)</p>\n<p>So what is really going on?</p>\n<h2 id=\"reverse-engineering-r2r-stomped-code\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#reverse-engineering-r2r-stomped-code\">#</a> Reverse Engineering R2R Stomped code</h2>\n<p>I will explain with the help of 2 challenges that utilised this very technique:  <code>Trompeloeil</code>  from  <code>Insomni'hack teaser 2024</code> , and  <code>Delirium</code>  from  <code>AOFCTF 24</code>  (the latter being a challenge made by a friend of mine, <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly90d2l0dGVyLmNvbS9oZXhhbWluZTIy\">hexamine22</span>, which later inspired me to make this blog).</p>\n<p>Let's take a look at the second one 1st, Delirium.</p>\n<p>Opening up the file in CFF Explorer, and heading over to the  <code>.NET Directory</code> , and checking the offset of the ManagedNativeHeader RVA, we can see that adding 8 and checking the DWORD at that location tells us what kind of format this specific dll was compiled in.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-1.png\" alt=\"cff explorer delirium\" /></p>\n<p>Opening the same offset (+8) in a hex editor like GHEX, we can see this</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-2.png\" alt=\"delirium ghex\" /></p>\n<p>The part we need to focus on here is to see that the value of the DWORD is 0x00525452 (&quot;RTR&quot;), signifying that this dll was compiled in the Ready to Run format.</p>\n<p>Opening up the decompiled code in ILSpy, we get something very peculiar:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-3.png\" alt=\"ilspy delirium\" /></p>\n<p>What? Just a md5 hash check for the flag? That doesn't seem right 🤔</p>\n<p>A wise man once said...</p>\n<p><code>When in doubt, read the assembly</code>  (in this case, the IL will suffice)</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-4.png\" alt=\"ilspy assembly delirium\" /></p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-6.png\" alt=\"tom sus\" /></p>\n<p>Hmm, looks odd. Why are there so many  <code>nop</code>  instructions? Something seems wrong here.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, ILSpy has an option to show us Ready to Run assembly code (the one that's pre-compiled) for binaries that are compiled that way, and since our binary is an RTR one, it should be available.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-7.png\" alt=\"ilspy r2r delirium\" /></p>\n<p>This disassembly is completely different from what the C# decompilation showed us... wtf?</p>\n<p>From this, we can conclude one thing:<br />\n<img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-8.png\" alt=\"bamboozled\" /></p>\n<p>Given that we can read this assembly, there are multiple ways to progress with solving the challenge now.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Static analysis - Read the disassembly and figure out what is going on (boring ❌)</li>\n<li>Dynamic analysis - Debug and set a breakpoint at the dll main in IDA (or any debugger of your choice, I prefer IDA), and examine variables at runtime (the method we will be following ✅)</li>\n</ol>\n<p>So how do we do that?</p>\n<p>We can use this reasoning: The binary asks us for input, and that happens from the dll. Unless the input is entered, none of the actual logic happens, we can be sure of that from the disassembly. So, we can run the  <code>Delirium.exe</code>  file, and let it run until it stops and asks us for input - that is when we can be sure that the control flow has switched over to the DLL.</p>\n<p>Let us do that first.</p>\n<p>(Note: If you come across any exceptions being generated when letting the exe run, just pass them to the application. Those are general exceptions that come from control flow switching between different threads in the presence of a debugger)</p>\n<p>Now we need to find our dll main.</p>\n<p>View &gt; Open Subviews &gt; Segments will show us every segment of every file currently loaded<br />\nSearch for  <code>Delirium.dll</code>  among those, and look for the CODE section in those.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-9.png\" alt=\"ida segments view delirium\" /></p>\n<p>With some quick pwntools, we can grep for the bytes of the first couple of instructions of our dll's main.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">from</span> pwn <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> * </span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">assembly = <span class=\"string\">&quot;&quot;&quot;push r15</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">push r14</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">push r12</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">push rdi</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">push rsi</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"string\">push rbp&quot;&quot;&quot;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"built_in\">print</span>(asm(assembly))</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># output: b&#x27;AWAVATWVU&#x27;</span></span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Once you get to the start of the CODE section of the dll (the 1st one if more than one exist), simply click  <code>Alt+b</code>  in IDA (to search for bytes), and paste  <code>&quot;AWAVATWVU&quot;</code>  (with the quotes, since it's a byte string). Of all the results that show up, click on the one that are present in  <code>Delirium.dll</code> .</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/R2R-Ready-to-Run-Stomping-WTF/image-10.png\" alt=\"search view results\" /></p>\n<p>Double-clicking will lead you to a bunch of bytes, but that is only because IDA is interpreting those bytes as data, and not code.

What is eBPF?</p>\n<p>(I'm going to dive a little deep into eBPF and things surrounding it. If you're only here for the solution to the challenge, you can skip to the <a href=\"#the-solution\">solution</a>)</p>\n<h2 id=\"understanding-ebpf\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#understanding-ebpf\">#</a> Understanding eBPF</h2>\n<p>eBPF is a technology that can be used in the Linux kernel that is like running a very tightly bound (ability-wise) program directly in the kernel space. It is an event-driven language that can be used to hook kernel actions and perform specific tasks.</p>\n<p>It runs natively in the kernel space with the help of a JIT compiler.</p>\n<p>It’s basically a kernel level virtual machine that allows for programming of certain kernel level tasks, such as packet filtering, tracing, etc. Essentially a small computer inside the kernel that can run custom programs with restricted access.</p>\n<p>Basically, think of it as a Kernel level javascript running inside a restrictive VM.</p>\n<p>The obvious question that might come in your mind is - <strong>How is eBPF different from normal kernel drivers or kernel modules</strong>?</p>\n<p>Well, the answer to that is simple:<br />\neBPF programs don’t have nearly the amount of permissions as a regular kernel module, so you could say that they run in a much more constrained environment. They can’t make any drastic changes to the behaviour of the kernel, so this adds to their security and can help in reducing crashes. It’s  perfectly in between a user program and a kernel program, in the sense that it runs in the kernel space, but with restrictions that differentiate it from an actual kernel module.</p>\n<p>Now that we've got the basics out of the way, let's get back to solving the challenge.</p>\n<h2 id=\"our-approach\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#our-approach\">#</a> Our Approach</h2>\n<p>Some google searches tell us that eBPF can be disassembled using  <code>llvm</code> , so let's give that a try</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-beehive-bi0sCTF-2024/image-1.png\" alt=\"llvm output\" /></p>\n<p>Sure enough, we get the output, and in that we see a function called  <code>weird_function</code> , now let's take a look at what it does</p>\n<p>One thing to keep in mind is: eBPF has its own instruction set architecture, so everything from registers to calling convention will be different</p>\n<p>Quick overview of eBPF architecture:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">eBPF is a RISC register machine with 11 registers in total.

We can see that our program is doing something similar here.</p>\n<p>We know that eBPF harbours the capability to hook onto syscalls on the kernel, so could it be possible that it is trying to hook onto syscall 0x31337?<br />\nLet's confirm that hunch.</p>\n<p>A failed comparison of the syscall number with 0x31337 leads us to label-18, which is</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-beehive-bi0sCTF-2024/image-2.png\" alt=\"exit label\" /></p>\n<p>So I think we would need to make the syscall number 0x31337 to interact with this program.

System calls are the interface between user-space applications and the kernel, allowing programs to request services from the operating system.</p>\n<p>Some important (and interesting) features of Seccomp:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It allows you to define a filter that specifies which system calls are permitted for a particular process. By default, all syscalls are allowed, but with seccomp, you can create a &quot;policy&quot; that restricts this set.</li>\n<li>It uses BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter), which is a virtual machine that can execute a set of instructions to filter system calls. Think of BPF as a &quot;javascript for your kernel&quot;, because it resides in a VM on the kernel and responds to specific events that occur on the system to which it is attached. The filters are written using BPF assembly or even C, which are then compiled to BPF bytecode.</li>\n<li>It offers mainly 2 modes of operation - <em>strict</em> &amp; <em>filter</em>. In strict mode, the process starts with a seccomp filter in place, and any attempt to make an unallowed system call results in the termination of the process. Whereas in filter mode, the filter is applied only when explicitly requested by the process (we will look at the &quot;how&quot; of this later).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Looking for syscalls with the calling number  <code>317</code>  (seccomp's syscall number), we find this</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-Secure-Computing-IRIS-CTF/syscall_1337.png\" alt=\"Seccomp syscall\" /></p>\n<p>Hmm, let's look at the arguments passed to it<br />\nThe prototype of the seccomp syscall looks like this:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">syscall(SYS_seccomp, unsigned int operation, unsigned int flags, void *args);</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Here, it seems like  <code>operation</code>  is set to 1<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">The system calls allowed are defined by a pointer to a Berkeley Packet </span><br><span class=\"line\">Filter (BPF) passed via args.

Klee, you could say, is a Symbolic Virtual Machine (Solver), that allows you to symbolically execute a C source file. This is advantageous for 2 main reasons:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You don't have to bother about having to convert C source to Python (to have to apply Z3 on it to solve symbolically)</li>\n<li>While converting from C to Python, we don't have to worry about stuff like signedness and typecasting 😃</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Klee is a symbolic execution engine that explores program paths symbolically, treating variables as symbols rather than with concrete values. It is built on top of the LLVM compiler infrastructure, so this integration allows it to work easily with programs written in C/C++, and leverage LLVM capabilities for program analysis and transformation.</p>\n<h4 id=\"install-klee\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#install-klee\">#</a> <strong>Install Klee</strong></h4>\n<p>Install <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmRvY2tlci5jb20vZW5naW5lL2luc3RhbGwv\">Docker</span> (since that is what I used to run Klee on this)</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight bash\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">docker pull klee/klee</span><br><span class=\"line\">docker run --<span class=\"built_in\">rm</span> -ti --<span class=\"built_in\">ulimit</span>=<span class=\"string\">&#x27;stack=-1:-1&#x27;</span> klee/klee</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<h4 id=\"convert-c-source-to-bitcode\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#convert-c-source-to-bitcode\">#</a> <strong>Convert C source to Bitcode</strong></h4>\n<p>(Bitcode is the format of code that Klee operates on.
