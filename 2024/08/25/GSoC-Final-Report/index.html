I encountered some build issues, realized that a few steps in the instructions were incorrect, and submitted a PR to correct them. It wasn’t until later that I fully grasped the impact of that contribution. Knowing that my small fix could help others avoid the same frustration gave me a sense of fulfillment.</p><p>I discovered RTEMS while exploring organizations participating in GSoC 2024. As I browsed through the list of projects, one in particular caught my eye — tagged with <code>GDB</code> and <code>Python</code> . Given my background in Reverse Engineering, I was immediately drawn to it and knew I wanted to make it my project. When I received my GSoC acceptance email on May 2nd, during my 2nd year in Undergrad College, I knew this summer was going to be something special. I had heard a lot about the mentor-mentee model that GSoC champions and was eager to experience it firsthand.</p><h2 id="about-the-project"><a class="anchor" href="#about-the-project">#</a> About the Project</h2><p><img data-src="/images/post_images/GSoC-Final-Report/RTEMS-logo.png" alt="rtems logo"></p><p>RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for embedded systems requiring high reliability and deterministic behavior.</p><p>RTEMS provides the capability to build custom toolchains tailored to various target architectures, leveraging standard tools like GCC, Binutils, GDB and many more. These tools are essential for compiling, linking and debugging embedded applications on RTEMS.</p><p>The project involved modifying the <span class="exturl" data-url="aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VyY2V3YXJlLm9yZy9nZGIv">GNU Debugger (GDB)</span> to enhance its debugging capabilities within RTEMS.</p><h2 id="problem-statement"><a class="anchor" href="#problem-statement">#</a> Problem Statement</h2><p>GDB includes built-in support for automatically loading Python, but this feature is limited to dynamic executables. In such cases, when a specific library is loaded by the object file in GDB, the linker triggers GDB to load the corresponding pretty-printing scripts for that library.</p><p>However, RTEMS is fully statically linked, and this automatic loading does not apply to statically linked executables. Without a linker to notify GDB when a library is loaded, Python is not automatically loaded. As a result, many features that rely on Python are unavailable, leading to a significant loss in functionality during debugging.</p><h2 id="project-goals"><a class="anchor" href="#project-goals">#</a> Project Goals</h2><ul><li>Integrate a Python initializer into GDB for RTEMS to facilitate enhanced debugging.</li><li>Enable GDB to automatically load pretty-printing scripts for RTEMS structures and libstdcxx classes.</li><li>Seamlessly integrate these changes into the RTEMS toolchain, reducing the need for involvement from the user.</li></ul><h2 id="approach"><a class="anchor" href="#approach">#</a> Approach</h2><p>A brief summary of my approach is as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Initial Exploration:</strong> I began by reviewing existing solutions employed by companies like Rust and AdaCore, which typically involve adding a wrapper over the host GDB to resolve paths for pretty-printers. To gain deeper insights, I engaged in discussions with developers from both companies as well as with GDB developers to understand the rationale behind this approach. However, I found this method unsuitable for RTEMS due to its use of a distinct toolchain for each build, separate from the host toolchain. Additionally, the wrapper approach proved to be generally inefficient for our needs.</li><li><strong>Implemented Solution:</strong> I introduced a .debug_gdb_scripts section to every ELF binary. This was done by adding the section in the <code>cpukit/sapi/src/exinit.c</code> file, since it is linked to every application built on RTEMS. As a result, every RTEMS-built application now includes this section.</li><li><strong>Python script execution:</strong> This new executable section contains a snippet of Python code that corrects paths and triggers GDB to run a script called <code>pprinter.py</code> . This script is responsible for registering both libstdcxx and RTEMS pretty-printers.</li><li><strong>Toolchain Integration:</strong> The <code>stdcxx.py</code> script, which registers the <code>libstdcxx</code> pretty-printers, needs to know the version of GCC being used since the pretty-printer scripts provided by GCC vary with versions. Therefore, the script is built alongside the toolchain to ensure compatibility.</li><li><strong>RTEMS Pretty-Printer Registration:</strong> Finally, the <code>pprinter.py</code> script invokes a build function from rtems_pprinter.py, which registers all the RTEMS-specific pretty-printers.</li></ul><p>Here is a flow chart highlighting the work flow underwent for the entire project:</p><p><img
