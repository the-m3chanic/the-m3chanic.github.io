This was very unique as it wasn't like any of the other RE focused CTFs we've played before and the style was really different.</p>\n<p>The entire thing began with a CTF which had all categories you would expect in a normal CTF (RE, Pwn, Web, Forensics). Us being low level guys, managed to get down RE and Pwn, and took a bit of time with Forensics. Sadly Web was too guessy for us 😔 (blind + skill issue). They froze the scoreboard like 30 mins into the CTF but I figure we qualified since they sent us a mail for the next round.</p>\n<p>After the prelims CTF, I think the top 25-30 teams were picked for the next round. The next round was a RE specific CTF. That one was super easy except for one challenge which was broken, I think. They pushed a fix for it and then we solved that too. So far it was looking pretty normal and we weren't sure what the &quot;hackathon&quot; part of this was.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-hackathon-tho\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-hackathon-tho\">#</a> What is a hackathon tho?</h3>\n<p>For context, a Hackathon is a software engineering/development oriented competition wherein teams are given certain topics/themes and guidelines to follow, and they have X amount of time to build a working product or a prototype, which they can then showcase to the judges and based on the judgement received they would get credited a certain number of points.</p>\n<h2 id=\"defense-phase\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#defense-phase\">#</a> Defense phase?</h2>\n<p>So after the 2 prelim rounds of CTFs, 20-25 teams were picked for the Hackathon (aka &quot;Defense&quot;) phase. This is where the uniqueness of the entire thing began. We were given a document that outlined what we would need to do and the specifications we were allowed to use. The entire specification is <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20vZG9jdW1lbnQvZC8xaUJHZ1NCeUdsRDkxdVdVT3o2QlRtQ1JweEN1N21IMUotcmZyTFBEdFdCRS9lZGl0\">here</span>.</p>\n<p>TL;DR</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We are given a  <code>main.c</code>  file, with 3 sensitive values:  <code>key</code>  (a 16-byte AES Key),  <code>egg_params</code>  (a 5x6 array) and a function  <code>compute_gf()</code></li>\n<li>Each team is given the same core binary with the above 3 things changed</li>\n<li>You &quot;defend&quot; your binary by obfuscating it such that the 3 sensitive values are hard to recover</li>\n<li>You &quot;attack&quot; other binaries by reversing and getting those 3 values, and submit them as flags</li>\n</ul>\n<p>In the defense phase, we were given criterion to follow with which we were to obfuscate our binaries. These were pretty basic, like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>No using any off the shelf obfuscators like UPX, CobaltStrike, etc.</li>\n<li>Code must be written by members of our team, and no one else</li>\n<li>The obfuscated binary must be functionally the same as the original, etc.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Okay.. enough yap<br />\nThis blog is more to focus on one of the challenges made by some folks at <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9pbmZvc2VjaWl0ci5pbg==\">InfosecIITR</span>.</p>\n<p>They made an LLVM based obfuscator, and while our challenge was something similar, it followed a different style from theirs. We went for a control flow flattening approach - while they went for more of a instruction overlap approach. It was an easy challenge, but I just wanted to showcase some cool things IDAPython is capable of.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-challenge\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#the-challenge\">#</a> The Challenge</h2>\n<p>The binary itself had a behaviour exactly the same as the others in the competition - give it plaintext as a command line argument, and it would encrypt it and give it back to you.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">apollo@apollo:/mnt/f/Work/CTFs/binary-clash-25/attack-phase/3$ ./3_VMwhere</span><br><span class=\"line\">Invalid Usage!!</span><br><span class=\"line\">Usage: ./encrypt &lt;plain_text&gt;</span><br><span class=\"line\">apollo@apollo:/mnt/f/Work/CTFs/binary-clash-25/attack-phase/3$ ./3_VMwhere hello</span><br><span class=\"line\">Plaintext :: 68 65 6c 6c 6f 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00</span><br><span class=\"line\">Ciphertext:: a0 6b 44 12 fc bd d2 a0 0c 71 d5 4b ba d6 84 94</span><br><span class=\"line\">Egg 0 : 0x28</span><br><span class=\"line\">Global Flag: 0x77</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Now, looking at it in IDA, I wouldn't say it was the prettiest binary I've ever seen.<br />\nIf you look for the main function in the normal Linux ELF method (look for  <code>start</code> , then find the first argument passed to the function -  <code>libc_start_main</code>  - which is explicitly called by start), you will first off see that IDA marks it as a location and not a subroutine - meaning that something is off already.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image.png\" alt=\"looking at start in IDA Pro\" /></p>\n<p>And at the location:<br />\n<img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-1.png\" alt=\"disassembly of main\" /></p>\n<p>That definitely does not look right.</p>\n<p>The  <code>jmp</code>  at  <code>0x40B234</code>  definitely looks suspicious, why is it jumping to the address of its own basic block + 5?</p>\n<p>You can press  <code>u</code>  to undefine code at a given position in IDA, and  <code>c</code>  to redefine it as code. Let us undefine code starting from  <code>0x40B228</code> , and defone code starting at  <code>0x40B228 + 5</code>  -&gt;  <code>0x40B22D</code> , and see where that takes us.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-2.png\" alt=\"hidden jump\" /></p>\n<p>Looks like the code there is being interpreted as data, we can fix that easily (hit  <code>u</code>  at that address and then hit  <code>c</code> ). Doing so, gives us this</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-3.png\" alt=\"hidden jump but fr this time\" /></p>\n<p>Well well well, what do we have here? A hidden  <code>jmp</code>  instruction.</p>\n<p>Analysing the code at that location gives us similar looking stuff</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-4.png\" alt=\"2nd obfuscation place\" /></p>\n<p>Applying the same stuff again, gives us the same results, except an instruction before the same old block again</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/Defeating-an-LLVM-based-obfuscator/image-7.png\" alt=\"jmp which leads to actual stuff\" /></p>\n<p>Again, with this  <code>jmp</code>  leading to a similar looking block, i.e:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>mov</code>  a random 8-byte value into  <code>rax</code></li>\n<li><code>xor eax, eax</code></li>\n<li><code>jmp</code>  into a location which is 5 bytes ahead of the basic block it belongs to, which will jump to a new location which may/may not have some code there, before it enters the same block again.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>At this point in the competition the pattern was clear to me, and I started figuring out a way to extract just the instructions we need (between the real  <code>jmp</code>  and before the next obfuscated block). So I settled on writing down an IDAPython script for this, since I work mainly with IDA Pro anyways.</p>\n<p>My idea was this:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Look for instructions matching the format mentioned above</li>\n<li>If the instruction is found, then find the 5th byte offset from the start of the block, and extract the address of the real  <code>jmp</code>  from on there</li>\n<li>At the new  <code>jmp</code>  address, keep reading instructions until you meet the next instruction matching the block</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Rinse. Repeat.</p>\n<p>I wanted to take this as a chance to check out how good IDA's Python API was, and basically take it on a test drive.</p>\n<p>Now I had to write an IDA Script to this (🗿), ahem, so we shall do that next</p>\n<p>The IDA Python documentation isn't exactly the best (if someone actually does find something, please hit me up), so I kind of had to rely mostly on <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9ncmVwLmFwcA==\">grep.app</span> to see examples of stuff similar to what I want to do.</p>\n<p>Some time of dilly dallying, and I made a rough script to fix up the main function.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span

binary - whichever functions were being called that is. So I went with a DFS approach.<br />\nFrom main, make a list of all the functions being called from inside it. Subsequently, add those to the &quot;deobfuscation&quot; queue. Likewise, keep going until there are no functions left.</p>\n<p>Also one annoying thing is inside IDA's API, all the instructions and registers are stored using codes instead of their actual names. I found that the method I've used in my script works for most cases.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span

boundaries by yourself. You can do that by right clicking anywhere inside the function/subroutine already defined.</p>\n<p>The script is kinda massive but I tried my best to make it as clean as possible so I can reuse parts of it later, hopefully someone shows me some goated IDA Python script snippets that are out there somewhere 🙏</p>\n<p>Thank you for reading this super-hurried post!
