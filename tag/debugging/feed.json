I encountered some build issues, realized that a few steps in the instructions were incorrect, and submitted a PR to correct them. It wasn’t until later that I fully grasped the impact of that contribution. Knowing that my small fix could help others avoid the same frustration gave me a sense of fulfillment.</p>\n<p>I discovered RTEMS while exploring organizations participating in GSoC 2024. As I browsed through the list of projects, one in particular caught my eye — tagged with  <code>GDB</code>  and  <code>Python</code> . Given my background in Reverse Engineering, I was immediately drawn to it and knew I wanted to make it my project. When I received my GSoC acceptance email on May 2nd, during my 2nd year in Undergrad College, I knew this summer was going to be something special. I had heard a lot about the mentor-mentee model that GSoC champions and was eager to experience it firsthand.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-the-project\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#about-the-project\">#</a> About the Project</h2>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/GSoC-Final-Report/RTEMS-logo.png\" alt=\"rtems logo\" /></p>\n<p>RTEMS (Real-Time Executive for Multiprocessor Systems) is an open-source real-time operating system (RTOS) designed for embedded systems requiring high reliability and deterministic behavior.</p>\n<p>RTEMS provides the capability to build custom toolchains tailored to various target architectures, leveraging standard tools like GCC, Binutils, GDB and many more. These tools are essential for compiling, linking and debugging embedded applications on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>The project involved modifying the <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VyY2V3YXJlLm9yZy9nZGIv\">GNU Debugger (GDB)</span> to enhance its debugging capabilities within RTEMS.</p>\n<h2 id=\"problem-statement\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#problem-statement\">#</a> Problem Statement</h2>\n<p>GDB includes built-in support for automatically loading Python, but this feature is limited to dynamic executables. In such cases, when a specific library is loaded by the object file in GDB, the linker triggers GDB to load the corresponding pretty-printing scripts for that library.</p>\n<p>However, RTEMS is fully statically linked, and this automatic loading does not apply to statically linked executables. Without a linker to notify GDB when a library is loaded, Python is not automatically loaded. As a result, many features that rely on Python are unavailable, leading to a significant loss in functionality during debugging.</p>\n<h2 id=\"project-goals\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#project-goals\">#</a> Project Goals</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>Integrate a Python initializer into GDB for RTEMS to facilitate enhanced debugging.</li>\n<li>Enable GDB to automatically load pretty-printing scripts for RTEMS structures and libstdcxx classes.</li>\n<li>Seamlessly integrate these changes into the RTEMS toolchain, reducing the need for involvement from the user.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"approach\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#approach\">#</a> Approach</h2>\n<p>A brief summary of my approach is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Initial Exploration:</strong> I began by reviewing existing solutions employed by companies like Rust and AdaCore, which typically involve adding a wrapper over the host GDB to resolve paths for pretty-printers. To gain deeper insights, I engaged in discussions with developers from both companies as well as with GDB developers to understand the rationale behind this approach. However, I found this method unsuitable for RTEMS due to its use of a distinct toolchain for each build, separate from the host toolchain. Additionally, the wrapper approach proved to be generally inefficient for our needs.</li>\n<li><strong>Implemented Solution:</strong> I introduced a .debug_gdb_scripts section to every ELF binary. This was done by adding the section in the  <code>cpukit/sapi/src/exinit.c</code>  file, since it is linked to every application built on RTEMS. As a result, every RTEMS-built application now includes this section.</li>\n<li><strong>Python script execution:</strong> This new executable section contains a snippet of Python code that corrects paths and triggers GDB to run a script called  <code>pprinter.py</code> . This script is responsible for registering both libstdcxx and RTEMS pretty-printers.</li>\n<li><strong>Toolchain Integration:</strong> The  <code>stdcxx.py</code>  script, which registers the  <code>libstdcxx</code>  pretty-printers, needs to know the version of GCC being used since the pretty-printer scripts provided by GCC vary with versions. Therefore, the script is built alongside the toolchain to ensure compatibility.</li>\n<li><strong>RTEMS Pretty-Printer Registration:</strong> Finally, the  <code>pprinter.py</code>  script invokes a build function from rtems_pprinter.py, which registers all the RTEMS-specific pretty-printers.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here is a flow chart highlighting the work flow underwent for the entire project:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/GSoC-Final-Report/project-flowchart.png\" alt=\"project flow chart\" /></p>\n<p>(Note: The boxes in Blue signify changes that apply to every

            "content_html": "<p>Extending the features of a debugger, especially GDB, sounded like a fun and interesting project at first glance. I already have quite a bit of experience working with GDB, and use it almost daily while Reverse Engineering or during CTFs.<br />\nFor those of you that are not familiar, CTF stands for &quot;Capture the Flag&quot;. It is a competition wherein the hosting team creates and puts out challenges/services that are intentionally vulnerable - usually in a way that is specific to a single field of Cyber Security - and the point of the challenge is to figure out what the vulnerability is and use it to get a text string from it called a &quot;flag&quot;. Capture more flags, gain more points. I play CTFs with <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9iaTBzLmlu\">team bi0s</span>.</p>\n<p>GDB has an awesome Python API that it utilizes to do things it cannot do straight out the box, and one such thing is pretty-printing.</p>\n<p>Imagine you have a weird class/structure in your program, and you want to view it in memory, so you pop it open in GDB. Then you print your variable in GDB and it spits out something so awful that you wish you never started debugging in the first place. This is because GDB obviously cannot know about any and every single structure out there, and sometimes it needs a little help - this is where the awesome Python API I mentioned comes in.</p>\n<p>Python essentially hooks onto GDB and interprets something GDB might be unable to, then do some Python magic and voila, you have the same structure neatly formatted! Some nice examples and a deeper explanation of what pretty-printing can be found in the <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9zb3VyY2V3YXJlLm9yZy9nZGIvY3VycmVudC9vbmxpbmVkb2NzL2dkYi5odG1sL1ByZXR0eS1QcmludGluZy5odG1sI1ByZXR0eS1QcmludGluZw==\">documentation</span></p>\n<p>GCC ships pretty-printing scripts for  <code>libstdcxx</code> , which is essentially all of the C++ STL Structures, and my job is to get the GDB installed on <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucnRlbXMub3Jn\">RTEMS</span> to automatically load these pretty-printing scripts at load-time, to enhance the debugging experience on RTEMS 😃. Next, add pretty-printing support for kernel structures present on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>Starting off, I already had a couple of things to get ticked off my checklist. I mainly wanted to set up a proper debugging environment, and also study various commonly used kernel structures - before diving deeper into my project. Since my project itself was to extend the functionality of the debugger, what good is it if I don't have a debugging environment setup in place?</p>\n<p>Let's jump right into my debugger setup then.</p>\n<p>I am working on a Windows 11 (x64), WSL2 (Arch) system. On top of this, I have the RTEMS tooling installed from the instructions in their <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnJ0ZW1zLm9yZy9icmFuY2hlcy9tYXN0ZXIvdXNlci9zdGFydC9zb3VyY2VzLmh0bWw=\">documentation</span>. On top of that, they provide a variety of options to build various BSPs (think of BSPs as housing for the OS to be embedded upon). I needed a build setup such that:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I could compile RTEMS C++ programs at will</li>\n<li>GDB could debug those programs remotely through a remote emulator (either built in, or using <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cucWVtdS5vcmc=\">Qemu</span>)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>First, to build a BSP. I had to make 2 important choices:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Which architecture will I use?</li>\n<li>Which BSP will I use for said architecture? (Note: A single architecture can support multiple BSPs)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I initially thought  <code>x86_64</code>  arch, along with any suitable BSP for that arch would have me good to go, but I was sadly mistaken. Not only did I struggle to find BSPs for  <code>x86_64</code> , but I also found that there were no test configurations (yet) for any of the  <code>x86_64</code>  BSPs 😦, so I decided not to proceed with that</p>\n<p>Next up, I chose the  <code>sparc</code>  arch, along with the  <code>erc32</code>  BSP, since that was one which seemed to have very good support for emulation and GDB support, and was also the one used in most of the examples mentioned in the docs. So I went ahead and built that.</p>\n<p><code>sparc</code>  has an emulator built in in RTEMS,  <code>sparc-rtems6-sis</code>  ( <code>sis</code> : Sparc Instruction Set Simulator), which can emulate the instructions of the RTEMS executable, and GDB can attach to the process through a TCP port.</p>\n<p>However, although compiling RTEMS C++ programs and running them worked perfectly on my  <code>sparc/erc32</code>  build, I couldn't debug (i.e, step through) code conveniently. I kept hitting some kind of data access violation exception, due to which RTEMS would have a fatal crash and exit. Sad.</p>\n<p>So I finalised on the  <code>arm/xilinx_zynq_a9_qemu</code>  BSP upon the suggestion of my mentor, which worked perfectly. So, I will be using that for the rest of this blog.</p>\n<p>First, a sample C++ program.<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight cpp\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\">// main.cc </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;numeric&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;iostream&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;vector&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"function\"><span class=\"type\">int</span> <span class=\"title\">main</span><span class=\"params\">()</span> </span>&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">auto</span> v = std::<span class=\"built_in\">vector</span>&lt;<span class=\"type\">int</span>&gt;(<span class=\"number\">5</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    std::<span class=\"built_in\">iota</span>(std::<span class=\"built_in\">begin</span>(v), std::<span class=\"built_in\">end</span>(v), <span class=\"number\">0</span>);</span><br><span class=\"line\">    </span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">for</span> (<span class=\"keyword\">auto</span> i : v) </span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">        std::cout &lt;&lt; i &lt;&lt; std::endl;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    &#125;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"number\">0</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>First off, RTEMS uses  <code>waf</code>  (an alternative to  <code>make</code> ), to build BSPs and applications on the platform. It's pretty versatile and easy to understand. You need 2 main things to build any app like this on RTEMS (apart from the source, of course) -  <code>waf</code>  (the script doing all the work) &amp;  <code>wscript</code>  (the waf script containing instructions to be executed). Apart from these 2 files, you would also need some dependency files, and an initialisation script.</p>\n<p><span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9kb2NzLnJ0ZW1zLm9yZy9icmFuY2hlcy9tYXN0ZXIvdXNlci9zdGFydC9hcHAuaHRtbA==\">This</span> page in the documentation gives a pretty good overview on how one can build an app on RTEMS.</p>\n<p>Here is my  <code>wscript</code>  for all C++ applications like the one above:<br />\n<figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br><span class=\"line\">13</span><br><span class=\"line\">14</span><br><span class=\"line\">15</span><br><span class=\"line\">16</span><br><span class=\"line\">17</span><br><span class=\"line\">18</span><br><span class=\"line\">19</span><br><span class=\"line\">20</span><br><span class=\"line\">21</span><br><span class=\"line\">22</span><br><span class=\"line\">23</span><br><span class=\"line\">24</span><br><span class=\"line\">25</span><br><span class=\"line\">26</span><br><span class=\"line\">27</span><br><span class=\"line\">28</span><br><span class=\"line\">29</span><br><span class=\"line\">30</span><br><span class=\"line\">31</span><br><span class=\"line\">32</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"comment\"># wscript </span></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">from</span> __future__ <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> print_function</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">rtems_version = <span class=\"string\">&quot;6&quot;</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">try</span>:</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> rtems_waf.rtems <span class=\"keyword\">as</span> rtems</span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">except</span>:</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"built_in\">print</span>(<span class=\"string\">&#x27;error: no rtems_waf git submodule&#x27;</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">import</span> sys</span><br><span class=\"line\">    sys.exit(<span class=\"number\">1</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">init</span>(<span class=\"params\">ctx</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.init(ctx, version = rtems_version, long_commands = <span class=\"literal\">True</span>)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">bsp_configure</span>(<span class=\"params\">conf, arch_bsp</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\"># Add BSP specific configuration checks</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">pass</span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">options</span>(<span class=\"params\">opt</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.options(opt)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">configure</span>(<span class=\"params\">conf</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.configure(conf, bsp_configure = bsp_configure)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"keyword\">def</span> <span class=\"title function_\">build</span>(<span class=\"params\">bld</span>):</span><br><span class=\"line\">    rtems.build(bld)</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    bld(features = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;cxx cxxprogram&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        target = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;cxx_stdvec.exe&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        cxxflags = <span class=\"string\">&#x27;-std=c++11 -g -O2 -lstdc++&#x27;</span>,</span><br><span class=\"line\">        source = [<span class=\"string\">&#x27;main.cc&#x27;</span>, <span class=\"string\">&#x27;rtems_config.c&#x27;</span>])</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>The main function we need to focus on is  <code>build</code> .
