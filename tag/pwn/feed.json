We can see that the challenge binary was compiled with the  <code>-fno-stack-protector</code>  option, what does that do?</p>\n<p>Well, before we discuss that I think a small refresher on the stack would be nice.</p>\n<h3 id=\"a-stack-refresher\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#a-stack-refresher\">#</a> A Stack Refresher</h3>\n<p>(I will be using  <code>x86_64</code>  as an example to explain)</p>\n<p>The stack is used to store local variables (on a per-function basis) during program runtime.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>It is also important to clarify the difference between 2 terms: &quot;stack space&quot; and &quot;stack frame&quot;.</p>\n<p>Stack space is the space allocated by your OS for your current program, there is one stack space assigned per program, which is some amount of space in the RAM.</p>\n<p>Stack frame is the &quot;stack&quot; structure itself which is used up per-function in your program - each function has its own stack frame.<br />\nStack frames are constructed and destructed for every function that executes, and there can only be ONE stack frame in the current context at any given time. That means, only one stack pointer ( <code>rsp</code>  in x86-64), which points to the top of the stack - whichever is in the current context, and one base pointer ( <code>rbp</code>  in x86-64), which points to the base of the stack in the current context.</p>\n<p>So, if each function needs to have its own frame, we need a way to save each function's base and top pointers, right?</p>\n<p>First, let us look at how a normal stack looks for a regular function (say  <code>main()</code> )</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-2.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>(In actuality, the stack grows <em>downwards</em> in memory, i.e, the stack pointer is the one moving down when the base pointer stays constant above it, but I am just drawing it this way for easier visualisation)</p>\n<p>Okay, now we need to see how each function can maintain it's own stack frame while the overall program still uses only 2 pointers - one for the current stack top and another for the current stack base.</p>\n<p>Let us see how  <code>x86-64</code>  handles this.</p>\n<p>(I am assuming at least basic assembly knowledge at the time of writing this)</p>\n<p>Okay, let us say we are in main, with source code as follows:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight c\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br><span class=\"line\">10</span><br><span class=\"line\">11</span><br><span class=\"line\">12</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"meta\">#<span class=\"keyword\">include</span> <span class=\"string\">&lt;stdio.h&gt;</span></span></span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"><span class=\"type\">int</span> <span class=\"title function_\">main</span><span class=\"params\">(<span class=\"type\">int</span> argc, <span class=\"type\">char</span> *argv[])</span> </span><br><span class=\"line\">&#123;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"type\">int</span> x = <span class=\"number\">5</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"type\">int</span> y = <span class=\"number\">7</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"comment\">/* Assume find_sum() is defined somewhere in the program */</span></span><br><span class=\"line\">    find_sum(x, y);</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\">    <span class=\"keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"number\">0</span>;</span><br><span class=\"line\">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>At the line of the call to  <code>find_sum()</code> , the stack would have some values (these depend on the compiler you are using, but not of our concern anyways - what we are bothered with is the top and base pointers). Let us see the stack right <em>before</em> the call to  <code>find_sum()</code> :</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-3.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>(<strong>Note</strong>: The  <code>rsp</code>  and  <code>rbp</code>  only <em>point</em> to the top and bottom, they do not contain the values at the bottom/top of the stack - those can be gotten by dereferencing these pointers)</p>\n<p>So, the next line is our function call, let us see what happens.</p>\n<p>First off, every function call is translated into assembly as a  <code>call</code>  instruction, which transfers control flow to a different part of the code.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br><span class=\"line\">6</span><br><span class=\"line\">7</span><br><span class=\"line\">8</span><br><span class=\"line\">9</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"># something like this</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rdi, 5</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rsi, 7</span><br><span class=\"line\">call find_sum</span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"># remaining instructions in the program </span><br><span class=\"line\">mov eax, 0</span><br><span class=\"line\">leave </span><br><span class=\"line\">ret</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>We can see that there are also instructions after the call instruction, so once the different part of the code finishes executing, control flow would need to return to the next instruction ( <code>mov eax, 0</code> , in our case).</p>\n<p>Luckily for us, we have a register which tracks the address of the next instruction:  <code>rip</code> . Let us use that.</p>\n<p>To store  <code>rip</code>  temporarily, we can push it onto the stack.</p>\n<p>The  <code>call</code>  instruction in  <code>x86-64</code>  is actuall abstracted into 2 separate instructions:  <code>push rip</code>  and  <code>jmp rip</code> , so the control flow of our program is transferred there.</p>\n<p>Currently, our stack looks like this:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-4.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Now, what Intel does here is interesting.</p>\n<p>First, the old <em>value</em> of  <code>rbp</code>  is pushed onto the stack</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-5.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Now that the old  <code>rbp</code>  value is safe, the current top, is set as the new base (i.e,  <code>rsp</code>  and  <code>rbp</code>  now contain the same values, effectively pointing to the same address).</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-7.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /><br />\nAnd now, the stack for the new function is set up! The function is free to use its frame however it pleases (as long as it does not use up all the stack space allocated by the OS!).</p>\n<p>If we had to put what I just showed in pictures and translate it to assembly, it would look a little something like this:</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br><span class=\"line\">5</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\"># save the old value of rbp on the stack</span><br><span class=\"line\">push rbp </span><br><span class=\"line\"></span><br><span class=\"line\"># rbp = rsp, effectively setting the new &quot;base&quot; to the previous &quot;top&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">mov rbp, rsp</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>Now, logically, returning from a function would follow the opposite steps as setting up a stack frame for a function.</p>\n<p>First, the stack top pointer is brought down to the current base (opposite of what happened for setting up)</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-8.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next, the top value on the stack (which was the old base pointer) is popped into  <code>rbp</code> . This effectively moves the base pointer back to where it previously was.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-9.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next, the top value on the stack (which was the old value of  <code>rip</code> ), is popped into  <code>rip</code>  (this is abstracted as the instruction:  <code>ret</code> ).</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-10.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>And that's how it's done!</p>\n<p>This is how you can use just 2 pointers to effectively have however many stack frames you want (1 per function).</p>\n<p>Now, back to the challenge 😃</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis-continued\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#analysis-continued\">#</a> Analysis: continued</h2>\n<p>The  <code>-fno-stack-protector</code>  turns off the option to add a stack protection mechanism known as the &quot;stack cookie&quot; or the &quot;stack canary&quot;. Why does the stack need protection, though?</p>\n<p>Well, we have seen that, during a function call, the stack stores 2 critical values: the old base pointer ( <code>rbp</code> ) and the return address from where code flow needs to continue after the function call ( <code>rip</code> ). What if I can overwrite these values?</p>\n<p>What if there are some library functions (for example:  <code>gets</code> ), which use the stack as a buffer to store the value we give it, but do not perform any bound/size checks, and will accept any length of input and place it as it is on the stack?  <code>gets</code>  is one such example of a library function which does not care about the size of the input you give it, it will eat up as many characters as you give it.</p>\n<p>This effectively means I can overwrite the  <code>rip</code>  with whatever value I want, meaning I control the flow of execution of the program going forward.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-11.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>A stack canary is a kind of boundary wall that is used to prevent such attacks. It is a random value that is generated each time the program is run, and placed between the old  <code>rbp</code>  and any value(s) the function uses the stack for storing. So the new stack looks a little something like this:</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-12.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>The value of this canary is checked to see if it it was overwritten with something else. If it is not what it's supposed to be, the program simply exits. It is difficult (but not impossible in some cases), to beat this.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-13.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Next up,  <code>-Wno-deprecated-declarations</code>  - this just tells the compiler to keep quiet and not warn about any deprecated function(s) we might be using in our program.</p>\n<h2 id=\"step-2-program-analysis\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#step-2-program-analysis\">#</a> Step 2: Program Analysis</h2>\n<p>Before we try running the program, we need to make sure the binary is patched to refer to the linker and libc that we have been given in the handout. Luckily, there is a very handy tool for doing just this: <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL2lvMTIvcHduaW5pdA==\">pwninit</span>.</p>\n<p>Just install and run  <code>pwninit</code>  from the challenge directory and it will do the patching for you, and will generated a separate patched file, with the needed changes.</p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-14.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>This is what we get from running the binary a couple of times, let us open it up in IDA.</p>\n<p>Immediately, we can see a bunch of  <code>station_&lt;number&gt;</code>  functions, probably the function that gets called based on the station number we input, and it gets there using a  <code>jmp</code>  table. You can tell this because of the  <code>__asm &#123; jmp     rax &#125;</code>  that IDA has placed in the pseudocode. You can recover any jump table in IDA if you notice this by following this <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9oZXgtcmF5cy5jb20vYmxvZy9pZ29ycy10aXAtb2YtdGhlLXdlZWstNTMtbWFudWFsLXN3aXRjaC1pZGlvbXMv\">blog</span>.</p>\n<p>In the  <code>select_station</code>  function itself, we can see there is a call to  <code>printf</code>  with the input that we give to the program. This is a format string vulnerability.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability\"><a class=\"anchor\" href=\"#what-is-a-format-string-vulnerability\">#</a> What is a format string vulnerability?</h3>\n<p>In assembly, there is something known as a &quot;calling convention&quot;. This refers to the places where any function looks at first when it is called, to know what arguments were passed to it.</p>\n<p>In  <code>x86-64</code>  the calling convention is as follows:  <code>rdi</code> ,  <code>rsi</code> ,  <code>rdx</code> ,  <code>rcx</code> ,  <code>r8</code> ,  <code>r9</code> . If a function has more arguments than this, the stack is used for the remaining ones.</p>\n<p>This just means that, printf (and all other functions) will look at these registers in these order, followed by the stack to know what it has to print out to the console.</p>\n<p>Now in our program, the printf call is vulnerable because it does not inherently control how many values it prints out.

From the Dockerfile we saw earlier, the idea is to get a shell and do  <code>cat flag.txt</code> , so let's see how we can do it.</p>\n<p>Back to the format string vulnerability.</p>\n<p>We know the  <code>printf()</code>  in  <code>select_station</code>  is vulnerable, and we know why. Let us view the register state before the  <code>printf()</code>  call in  <code>select_station</code></p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-16.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>Running  <code>info proc mappings</code>  on GDB tells us what is mapped to where in virtual memory, so we can make use of that here</p>\n<p>We can see that the address that  <code>rsi</code>  contains is actually a LIBC address!</p>\n<p>We can assume ASLR is on for this program.</p>\n<p>One interesting thing to note about ASLR is that while it does modify the actual addresses of variables and functions in your program, it usually does not touch the distance between these variables (this distance is also known as an &quot;offset&quot;).</p>\n<p>For example, if we run a program for the first time, and a variable  <code>x</code>  is at address  <code>0x1000</code> , and a variable  <code>y</code>  is at  <code>0x1050</code> , and we run this program for a second time, we would see that the address of the variable  <code>x</code>  has now changed to  <code>0x1450</code> , but  <code>y</code>  remains a constant offset from it at  <code>0x14a0</code> .</p>\n<p>This is because it would take way too long for ASLR to randomise the locations of <em>every</em> single variable in a given program. What is does instead is randomise the <em>base</em> address of various memory mappings, one of which is LIBC.</p>\n<p>We can utilise this fact to find the base address of  <code>libc</code>  every time the program is run. This is known as a  <code>ret2libc</code>  attack</p>\n<p>There are 4 main steps to  <code>ret2libc</code>  attacks:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Find an address that points to something in the libc by using something like a format string vulnerability</li>\n<li>Use the address above to calculate the base address of libc</li>\n<li>Calculate addresses of any libc functions we like using the base address</li>\n<li>Use a different exploit (BOF in our case) to overwrite the return address with the libc function we would like to jump to</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us leak an address as an example, by running the program with the input &quot;14927-%p-&quot;</p>\n<p>The output I get is:  <code>0x7ffff7fc2723</code></p>\n<p><img data-src=\"/images/post_images/Writeup-lost-canary-UIUCTF24/image-17.png\" alt=\"alt text\" /></p>\n<p>All I have to do, is subtract the base address of the  <code>libc</code>  I have (highlighted in the screenshot), from it, to get the constant offset difference, which comes out to be:  <code>0x1ed723</code> . I can use this information to get the base address of the libc every time the program is run now, through the format string vulnerability in  <code>main()</code> .</p>\n<p>Return Oriented Programming comes in handy when buffer overflows allow us to overwrite a program's call stack with what we want. Instead of us having to craft our own shellcode, all we have to do is take already existing pieces of code (known as &quot;gadgets&quot;) and put them together to craft our exploit - we will see how we can do that.</p>\n<p>These gadgets are usually short bursts of instructions tailored to do specific things, each ending with a  <code>ret</code>  instruction. We can utilise this to control execution flow as per our will.</p>\n<p>The beauty of ROP comes from it's unique ability to harness code from any part of the binary (given it is executable).</p>\n<p>First, we need to go gadget hunting to find what we need. Since we can write what we want to the stack, and we know  <code>rdi</code>  is the first place looked at by functions for their arguments, we would ideally want something that would allow us to pop the top value from the stack and into  <code>rdi</code> , then perform a  <code>ret</code> . Let us look for such an instruction in the libc with a tool known as <span class=\"exturl\" data-url=\"aHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL0pvbmF0aGFuU2Fsd2FuL1JPUGdhZGdldA==\">ROPgadget</span>.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br><span class=\"line\">3</span><br><span class=\"line\">4</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ ROPgadget --binary ./libc.so.6 | grep &quot;pop rdi ; ret&quot;</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x0000000000023b6a : pop rdi ; ret</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x00000000000f57ad : pop rdi ; retf</span><br><span class=\"line\">0x0000000000144ba9 : pop rdi ; retf 0xa</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>\n<p>We can take the first one and ignore the rest. The output shows that at the offset  <code>0x24b6a</code>  from the libc base, is the gadget we are looking for.</p>\n<p>Next, we also need to find a  <code>ret</code>  instruction.</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight plaintext\"><table><tr><td class=\"gutter\"><pre><span class=\"line\">1</span><br><span class=\"line\">2</span><br></pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"line\">$ ROPgadget

<code>ret</code>  is at 0x22679.</p>\n<p>Now, we are ready to craft our payload that does the following:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Send 4 &quot;A&quot;s and the canary to get to the return address on the stack</li>\n<li>Overwrite the return address on the stack with the  <code>pop rdi</code>  gadget</li>\n<li>Set the value of  <code>rdi</code>  to &quot;/bin/sh&quot;</li>\n<li>Overwrite the return address again with with the address of system</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Let us see how this can be accomplished with a full fledged pwntools script</p>\n<p><figure class=\"highlight py\"><table><tr><td
